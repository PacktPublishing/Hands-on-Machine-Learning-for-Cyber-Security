**Safeguard your system by making your machines intelligent using the Python ecosystem**

## What is this book about?
Cyber threats today are one of the costliest losses that an organization can face. In this book, we use the most efficient tool to solve the big problems that exist in the cybersecurity domain.

This book covers the following exciting features: 

* Use machine learning algorithms with complex datasets to implement cybersecurity concepts
* Implement machine learning algorithms such as clustering, k-means, and Naive Bayes to solve real-world problems
* Learn to speed up a system using Python libraries with NumPy, Scikit-learn, and CUDA
* Understand how to combat malware, detect spam, and fight financial fraud to mitigate cyber crimes
* Use TensorFlow in the cybersecurity domain and implement real-world examples
